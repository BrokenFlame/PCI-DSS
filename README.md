## Why should I help?
Many companies build and maintain PCI-DSS Envionments in AWS.  The requirements for each company are often very similar yet the approach can be very different.  This project helps individuals and companies save time and money by providing templates and guidelines to create a PCI-DSS ready environment in a significatly reduced time frame.

By providing a standard approach we hope to enable more companies to host and manage thier own PCI-DSS compliant envionment, which a QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) can easily assess based on the fact that they will already be very familiar with this project, and should only need to inspect where you have decided to differ.
